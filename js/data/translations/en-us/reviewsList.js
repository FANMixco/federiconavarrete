Furthermore, Frederico seems to be a person that truly cares, that wants to add value and make a difference. Keep up the great work and thank you for your time!`,

			"review": `I've known Federico for about 20 years so I speak from actual experience when I say that he's trustworthy, responsible, intelligent and loyal to his principles. Federico and I were classmates during school and college. During this time I developed a strong friendship relationship with him. My close association to him made me witness his stupendous growth as a person and as a professional. He's the most agile developer I've ever known. He creates clean, maintainable code in half the time of his peers. This is a consequence of his highly analytical 
	personality and strong passion for computer science.<br /><br />On the other hand, Federico has been working hard to develop his interpersonal skills. To do so, he participated in various communities that require him to take a leadership role, such as Microsoft Student Partners and Toastmasters. In the latter, Federico gained confidence and developed the art of public speaking.<br /><br />There's no doubt that Federico is a person of integrity, with a well-balanced set of technical and interpersonal skills. For all of this, it is my pleasure to recommend Federico.`,
